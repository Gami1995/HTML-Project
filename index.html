                    DnD is a tabletop rpg game that can be played with as many people as you want, you can even play it on your own. The Basics of it is that you make a character that interatcs with a world made by the creators or by your own friends, you can even make your own worlds for you and your friends to explore.

                    DnD is very simple and eay to play, all you need are dice. you can buy a full set of dice for DnD for less than $5, there are 7 different dice needed to play, all with different uses. The most important thing to remember about DnD is that you control the character and define who they are, you can be a hero or villain, It's your choice.

                    The characters in DnD are a bit hard to set up when you don't know how to set it all up. It is ok to take things slow, I would recommend following easy and quick guides from other players like JoCat, he makes it fun and very quick. DnD is all about choices and how you want to play, you can cast poweful magic or just go in with a sword and shield, or you can sing and give taverns plenty of popularity. Make these characters how you want it and don't let people hate it, show them the beauty of your creation.

                    DnD requires something difficult that isn't quick to make and that is a world, within this world are many characters and events and not everyone has the ime or mind to make these worlds, but no worries, the game has hundreds of stories built for you to enjoy in different books and sets. Have fun with these pre built worlds whre you and your party can just enjoy life and effect it how you so desire.

                    Dungeons and Dragons gives you so much freedom where you can do anything that you want, you want to hire a whole village and start a cult, that is possible. You control your characters every action and choice and you can watch the world change with your actions. In DnD imagination is just the start of it, you can do so much that I can't even begin to list everything off.
